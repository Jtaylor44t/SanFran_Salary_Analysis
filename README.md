# SanFran_Salary_Analysis

This is a fictional scenario. The mayor of San Francisco wants to give government employees a raise. 
In this data set there are some government employees and some non government employees. The mayor would like to compare 
government salaries with private sector salaries. There are some questions that need answered first.

Some other questions can be asked, but these are the ones they asked to be prioritized and answered.
1) They'd like to know the average base pay in San Francisco.
2) They'd like to know who makes over 500k (total compensation).
3) They'd like to know who averages the most pay with base, overtime, and other pay combined.
4) They'd like to see how many employees are managers and how many are non managers.
5) They'd like to see how many employees make between 50-75k.
6) They'd like to see how many people are pulling in more than 50k in overtime pay.
7) What job titles have a minimum base pay of 100k.
8) How many employees haven't worked any overtime.

Here the conclusions after analyzing the data using SQL.
1) The average base pay in San Francisco is $66,325.
2) It looks like both Nathaniel Ford and Gary Jimenez have a total compensation including benefits of over half a million dollars a year. 
3) It looks like NATHANIEL FORD averages $189,198 with base, overtime, and other pay. This is the highest employee on the list.
4) 2,950 employees have a manager title. 95,486 employees have non manager titles.
5) 17,792 employees make between 50,000 and 75,000 
6) 1,573 employees bring in more than 50k in overtime pay
7) Some of the job titles with at least 100k base pay are Fire Department Chief, Chief of Police, Controller, Chief Investment Officer, and Administrator, DPH.
8) 76,720 employees do not have any overtime pay.

It seems like a lot of people in San Francisco are fairly compensated compared to the cost of living. A lot of money seems to be paid in overtime. It might be worth evaluating if the 
overtime really needs to be worked in the first place. The average base pay in San Francisco seems kind of low for the average cost of living there.
